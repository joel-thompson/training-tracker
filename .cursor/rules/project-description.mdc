# Training Tracker

A BJJ (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu) training tracker application built as a monorepo using Bun workspaces.

## Project Structure

- **`frontend/`** - React + Vite application
- **`backend/`** - Hono API server
- **`shared/`** - Shared types, utilities, and constants used by both frontend and backend

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite, TanStack Router
- **Backend**: Hono
- **Auth**: Clerk
- **Language**: TypeScript

## Frontend

### Routing

Frontend uses TanStack Router with file-based routing:
- Routes in `frontend/src/routes/`
- `__root.tsx` - Root layout
- `_app.tsx` - App layout (header, nav, auth) for authenticated routes
- Routes under `_app/` get the app layout automatically
- Route tree auto-generated in `routeTree.gen.ts`

To create a new route:
- Create a file in `frontend/src/routes/` (e.g., `my-route.tsx` for `/my-route`)
- Use `createFileRoute` with the route path
- For authenticated routes with app layout, place under `_app/` directory
- The route tree regenerates automatically on file changes
